- "Estimate pro-forma Debt/EBITDA for Shopify acquiring Pinterest"

- "Identify two midcap companies in the consumer discretionary sector that could be attractive M&A targets based on healthy EBITDA margins and manageable debt levels"
- "Estimate the post-acquisition debt/EBITDA ratio if Chewy (CHWY) were to acquire Five Below (FIVE) with a $2 billion cash+debt funded deal"
- "Assess whether a potential acquisition of Zynex (ZYXI) by Axon Enterprise (AXON) would make strategic sense based on sector overlap, size compatibility, and financial strength."
